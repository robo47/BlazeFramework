<a>
	This tag can be used with the commandLink-tag which can navigate with navigation rules and is equal to an commandButton.
	Example:
	<b:commandLink action="{myNut.nextView}"/>
	
	To be able to use normal links too the link-tag can be used, which does not require a form as parent. The link is not able to use navigation rules but can change the url.
	The best practise is to use links for the normal navigation and use the commandLink/Button only for forms, because submitting with these components does not affect the url.
	Example:
	<b:link href="http://www.google.com" value="Google site"/>

<abbr>
	This tag can be added as normal text into a textblock.
	There will be no own component, except a contributor suggests a solution.
	Example:

	<b:outputText value="That is the <abbr=\"World wide web\">WWW</abbr>"/>

<address>
	This tag can be used with the address-tag which is just a container
	Example:
	<b:address>
		<b:outputText value="{user.addressInfo}"/>
	</b:address>
	
<area>
	This tag can be used with the area-tag within an image-tag.
	Example:
	<b:image id="myImage" src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Image">
		<b:area shape="rect" coords="0,0,100,100" href="http://www.google.com" alt="Google site"/>
	</b:image>
