<a>
	This tag can be used with the commandLink-tag which can navigate with navigation rules or links.
	Example:
	<b:commandLink action="{myNut.nextView}"/>
	
	To be able to use normal links too the link-tag can be used, which does not require a form as parent.
	Example:
	TBA

<abbr>
	This tag can be added as normal text into a textblock.
	There will be no own component, except a contributor suggests a solution.
	Example:

	<b:outputText value="That is the <abbr=\"World wide web\">WWW</abbr>"/>

<address>
	This tag can be used with the address-tag which is just a container
	Example:
	<b:address>
		<b:outputText value="{user.addressInfo}"/>
	</b:address>
